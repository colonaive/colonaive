# Project COLONAiVEâ„¢

**A Clinician-Led National Movement to Outsmart Colorectal Cancer**

Project COLONAiVEâ„¢ is a public health initiative to modernize colorectal cancer (CRC) screening across Singapore and the region. It introduces a two-step screening regimen:

- **Step 1:** ColonAiQÂ® â€“ a CE-marked, China NMPA-cleared, HSA-cleared blood test for early detection  
- **Step 2:** Colonoscopy â€“ the gold standard for diagnosis and early treatment

This campaign is proudly clinician-led, powered by community support, and aims to increase early detection rates, save lives, and promote national health resilience.
